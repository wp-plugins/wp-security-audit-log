* New user is created via registration or created by another user
* Existing user changes the role or password of another user
* User uploads a file, changes a password or email
* Failed login attempt
* and much more...

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I prune WordPress security events? =

By default the plugin will keep up to 10,000 events. When this limit is reached, older events are deleted to make place for the new ones. You can configure the plugin to keep more events from the settings page. You can also configure the plugin to delete events which are older than a number of days.

= Is there a complete list of all WordPress security audit events? = 
Yes. A complete list can be found [here](http://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-plugins/wp-security-audit-log/security-audit-event-logs/)
